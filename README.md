A curated collection of high-impact analyses focused on socio-economic trends, public policy, and global health data.

📌 Featured Case Studies

🧬 Healthcare & Public Safety

* Firearm Mortality vs. Legislative Rigor: Analyzed the relationship between state-level gun laws and mortality rates using CDC statistics.

    * Key Insights: States with stricter gun laws showed 63.7% lower firearm related mortality rate than States with lax gun laws.
    
* Tools/Visuals: Heatmaps, bar plots, and Choropleth maps.

🥢Food Insecurity in the U.S.: Identified vulnerable demographics and geographic clusters facing food instability.

* Key Insights: The children population in the U.S. is disproportionately experiencing food insecurity than other age groups. TX, FL, NY, and CA have the highest number of children suffering from food insecurity.
    
* Tools/Visuals: Geographic distribution mapping and categorical bar analysis.

💰 Economic & Labor Market Intelligence
    
- Monetary Policy & Market Balance: Evaluated the Federal Government's ability to balance inflation and unemployment through interest rate controls .
    
    * Key Insights: Federal government has more control over inflation rate than unemployment rate. The ability to adjust the interest rate has direct effect on inflation but to a lesser degree for unemployment rate.
    
- Data Science Salary Determinants: Multi-factor analysis of salary trends and growth drivers in the global tech market.

    * Key Insights: The main factor that determines the salary range for data scientists is the residency in the U.S. followed by experience and job title.
    
Tools/Visuals: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly (box, line plots and treemap).

🌍 Climate & Resource Security
    
- Hurricane Patterns & Global Warming: Statistical analysis of hurricane frequency in relation to rising global temperatures.

    - Key Insights: Contrary to common beliefs, the rising global temperature has little effects on the occurances of hurricanes. The number of hurricanes, regardless of their strength, remained stable over the past 25 years despite the increasing global temperature.
    
- U.S. Mineral Supply Chain Risk: Evaluated national reliance on foreign imports for critical rare earth minerals.

    - Key Insights: The U.S. is overly reliant on China for mineral supplies. China alone accounts for ~31.7% of the mineral supplies to the U.S. even though it is a direct competitor to the U.S. In addtion, China has global dominance of rare earth mineral supplies. The U.S. should develop an alternative mineral supply partnership with other non-competitive countries.
    
Tools/Visuals: Choropleth maps, scatter plots, WordCloud, and sunburst charts.

🗳️ Political Science & Funding

- Federal Funding & Political Alignment: Investigated whether federal resource allocation correlates with state-level political party affiliation.

    - Key Insights: Although Joe Biden won the presidental election in 2020, the funding to States did not show bias towards Democratic States. Republican States continued to receive the majority of the Federal fundings.
    
Tools/Visuals: Correlation matrices and comparative bar plots.
